            Goosebumps was a horror kids show that originally aired in 1995. 
            Now I know what you're thinking. Goosebumps is a stupid kids show!
            Well let me tell you, when I was a child watching this stuff,
            I was terrified by some of these stories! They had decent plots
            and acting, and R.L. Stein was definitely out to spook some people!
            Some of my favorite Halloweens were spent watching these and they made
            my holidays and darkness something to fear. Watch if you dare, there 
            are some scares to beware!!!
