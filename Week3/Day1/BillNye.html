            Bill Nye the Science Guy was a show hosted by famed scientist
            Bill Nye that was introduced in 1993. It features Bill Nye along
            with different kids to show the importance of science and how it
            can affect our day to day lives. He always made my science classes
            growing up more interesting and fun, and can actually have an
            impact on future children learning to this day!
