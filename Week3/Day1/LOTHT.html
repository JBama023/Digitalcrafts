        LEGENDS OF THE HIDDEN TEMPLE

        Legends of the Hidden Temple was a Nickelodeon TV Game show that aired
        from 1993 to 1995. The show was composed of six teams (Red Jaguars,
        Blue Barracudas, Green Monkeys, Orange Iguanas, Purple Parrots, 
        and Silver Snakes) that competed in physical and mental events. 
        There were two kids per team, and all six teams would compete 
        in three rounds until there was only one team left. The final round would
        be the hardest challenge of the show, the Temple Run. This was one of the best
        best game shows to watch as a kid and definitely good to watch for a 
        nostalgia kick for any 90s kids!
