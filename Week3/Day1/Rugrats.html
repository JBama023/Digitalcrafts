        Rugrats was a very popular 90s show that introduced a cast of
        babies and their loving parents in 1991. The loveable babies went on
        many adventures and learned many lessons along the way. Tommy, along
        with Chuckie, Angelica, and the rest of the gang always had a way of
        trying to be the best babies they could be. This show is not only visually
        appealing; it is heartwarming, fun, and a joy for the whole family :)
