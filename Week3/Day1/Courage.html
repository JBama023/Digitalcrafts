            Courage the Cowardly Dog was a show originally aired in 1996.
            It was by war one of the freakiest shows I have ever seen. It contained
            some weird, trippy images. The earliest episodes had the strangest
            storylines and characters, but still held up as one of, if not
            one of the greatest shows of the 90s era. Please, PLEASE give this 
            one a watch. It'll definitely be worth it!
