        <p> Mars is a somewhat popular subject in terms of human spaceflight potential. Some
            believe that it is worthwhile in mankind's quest to gain more knowledge about the 
            surrounding solar system, while others believe it is a major waste of human resources.
            Here are the pros and cons of creating spacecraft capable of reaching
            the Red Planet, and additional resources if you would like to find
            out more. 
        </p>
        <h2>Pros:</h2>
        <p>Humans have always wanted to unlock the mysteries of our universe. It has 
        Taken centuries to gather the information that we have today. When the 
        world watched the first people land on the moon, everyone watched in awe as 
        astronaut Neil Armstrong took mankind's first steps on the moon. It was a difficult 
        feat, yet human ingenuity persevered. People learned more about the moon walking on it 
        than they did if they sent satellites to orbit around it. The same could be said about
        Mars. If humans were to walk on it, they could obtain more information than the 
        current rovers would, such as the existence of life. That would not be too far off,
        as water was admittedly found on the planet. Creating new technology for a Mars mission
        would also help Earth's Technology as well, such as better water and power methods, as 
        well as creating more methods for cultivating food. 
      </p>
      <h2>Cons:</h2>
      <p>Mars is currently 55 million kilometers away from Earth, while the moon is about 400,000
          kilometers. This means that it would take about 8-9 months for a spacecraft to even 
        get there. If humans were to get there, they would be facing a variety of challenges
        and hazards. For example, frequent dust storms last for weeks, and could severely damage
        spacecraft or the humans on mission. Other factors can include starvation, freezing,
        or heavy doses of radiation. If a crew were to be stranded on Mars, it could take 
        up to two years for a rescue crew to even begin the journey to mars. 
        Another factor to consider is the cost of such a mission.
        analysts estimate that the project could cost well over 500 million USD. That money
        could be used to fund different astronomical projects, such as asteroid redirect
        missions.  </p>
        <h2>Conclusion and Where we are at:</h2>
        <p> A mission to Mars would be a costly and dangerous, yet important step in understanding
        the planets we see through our telescopes. As far as a mission would go, NASA estimates
        that we could be sending the mission out in the 2030's. More technology and research 
        would be needed to get there, yet it would be one of the greatest achievements that 
        mankind could ever have. Below are some links for more information. </p>
